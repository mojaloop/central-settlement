# Serice to expose the Mojaloop settlements API 

The service is created using the hapi-openapi plugin.
The current Swagger API documentation can be found [here](./config/swagger.json)
The API is still only a design and the current code is the boilerplate for further development.

This is part of the Mojaloop project.
